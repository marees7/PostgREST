## PostgREST
    PostgREST is an open-source tool that serves a RESTful API directly from a PostgreSQL database. It's designed to make it easy to expose your database schema via a REST API without writing any custom server-side code. PostgREST automatically maps HTTP requests to SQL operations, providing a simple and efficient way to interact with your database.
